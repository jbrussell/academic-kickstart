Science communication has been a key component of my PhD. My efforts have ranged in scope from in-house events at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, including [Research as Art](https://researchasart.wordpress.com/), the [Seismic Sound Lab](http://www.seismicsoundlab.org/), and [Open House](https://openhouse.ldeo.columbia.edu/) to working with middle and high school students at the [American Museum of Natural History](https://www.amnh.org/) and speaking to undergraduates at minority-serving institutions as an [IRIS Recruitment Speaker](https://www.iris.edu/hq/internship/recruitment).
