<!-- # About -->

I am a seismologist studying upper mantle processes. My research focuses primarily on surface-wave imaging of the oceanic lithosphere-asthenosphere system using ocean bottom data. I am interested in the structure and evolution of the oceanic upper mantle, including how the lithosphere forms and evolves, the nature of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, and *in situ* constraints on mantle petrofabrics. I also have an interest in using [data visualization and sonification](#outreach) as a tool for science communication and outreach.
